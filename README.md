## Exploratory Analysis and Preprocessing Results

### Label Distribution

The final cleaned dataset includes **622 soil samples**, with the outcome variable defined as the binary presence or absence of *Listeria spp.* based on culture results.

```text
Listeria present:  311 samples (50%)
Listeria absent:   311 samples (50%)
```

### Correlation Structure of Predictors

A Pearson correlation matrix was computed across soil chemistry, climate, land-use, and geographic variables to examine linear dependencies and potential multicollinearity among predictors.

**Key observations:**
- Soil nutrients (e.g., total nitrogen, organic matter, and trace metals) form correlated clusters  
- Climate variables exhibit strong regional structure  
- Land-use variables show expected compositional relationships  
- No single predictor displays extreme correlation with the outcome label  

These patterns indicate structured but non-redundant predictors, supporting their retention in downstream tree-based models.

### Univariate Effect Size Analysis (Cliff’s Delta)

To quantify the magnitude and direction of associations between individual predictors and *Listeria* presence, **Cliff’s Delta** was used as a nonparametric effect size measure. This approach emphasizes practical relevance beyond statistical significance alone.

#### Top Variables by Absolute Cliff’s Delta

| Variable | Median (Absent) | Median (Present) | Δ (Present − Absent) | Cliff’s Δ | Adjusted p-value |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Shrubland (%) | 3.6009 | 0.3208 | −3.2801 | −0.44 | 5.9e−20 |
| Moisture | 0.1723 | 0.2887 | +0.1164 | +0.42 | 4.5e−18 |
| Cropland (%) | 1.1679 | 6.0231 | +4.8552 | +0.39 | 5.2e−16 |
| Longitude | −102.45 | −90.58 | +11.87 | +0.38 | 1.5e−15 |
| Pasture (%) | 0.3966 | 4.9012 | +4.5046 | +0.31 | 7.4e−11 |

All reported associations remained statistically significant after false discovery rate (FDR) correction.

---

### Land-use Composition by *Listeria* Presence

Comparisons of mean land-use composition revealed systematic differences between *Listeria*-positive and *Listeria*-negative soil samples.

**Observed patterns:**
- *Listeria*-absent soils are dominated by **shrubland and grassland**
- *Listeria*-present soils show higher proportions of **cropland and pasture**
- Shrubland coverage is markedly reduced in positive samples  

These patterns highlight the importance of land-use context in environmental *Listeria* persistence.

---

### Biological Interpretation

#### Land-use associations

*Listeria* presence is positively associated with **managed and disturbed landscapes**, particularly:
- Cropland  
- Pasture  

In contrast, *Listeria* absence is associated with **semi-natural vegetation**, including:
- Shrubland  
- Grassland  

This supports an **anthropogenic association hypothesis**, where *Listeria* persistence in soils reflects:
- Agricultural disturbance  
- Livestock activity  
- Manure application  
- Repeated environmental re-inoculation  

#### Soil and climate context

- Higher soil moisture and nutrient availability (e.g., nitrogen, organic matter, trace metals) are associated with *Listeria* presence  
- These variables likely act as **contextual modifiers**, influencing survival and persistence rather than serving as single causal drivers  

---

### Summary Statement

> *Univariate effect size analysis revealed that Listeria presence was negatively associated with semi-natural land cover (e.g., shrubland), while positively associated with soil moisture and managed land-use types, particularly cropland and pasture. However, substantial overlap in predictor distributions between presence and absence groups indicates that Listeria occurrence is not driven by single-variable thresholds, but rather by multivariate and nonlinear interactions, justifying the use of tree-based ensemble models for predictive modeling.*

## Model Selection (Food-Safety Priority)

We evaluated multiple binary classifiers (LogReg, SVM-RBF, Random Forest, ExtraTrees, HistGradientBoosting, LightGBM, and CatBoost) using an **80/20 train–test split** and **cross-validation** on the training set. Because this is a food-safety screening task, we prioritized **high sensitivity (recall)** to minimize **false negatives** (missed positives).

To reflect this priority, we:
- Computed **out-of-fold (OOF)** predicted probabilities on the training set for each model.
- Selected a **model-specific decision threshold** to achieve a target recall (e.g., **≥ 0.90**) based on OOF predictions.
- Ranked models primarily by **fewest FN**, then **fewest FP**, using **recall** as a tie-breaker.
- Fine-tuned the best-performing model(s) via hyperparameter search and evaluated final performance on the held-out test set.

### Summary of Spatila distribution of Listeria in soil samples across the United States.

<img width="2306" height="1238" alt="Rplot55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84f5eba6-67cb-4dc3-bd9b-788cd56e4fd9" />

#####  **Figure 1. Spatial distribution of Listeria soil samples incorporating elevation.**
Spatial distribution of soil samples across the continental United States, with point color indicating Listeria presence (1) or absence (0) and point size proportional to sampling site elevation (m). State boundaries are shown for geographic context. This visualization highlights heterogeneity in both sampling elevation and Listeria occurrence across regions.

The incorporation of elevation suggests a potential association between Listeria absence and higher-elevation sampling sites, as several negative samples (label = 0) are observed at comparatively higher elevations. While positive samples are present across a range of elevations, this visual pattern indicates that elevation—or correlated environmental factors such as temperature, moisture availability, and soil characteristics—may influence Listeria persistence. However, this observation is qualitative and warrants formal statistical evaluation.

<img width="2306" height="1238" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0fb4600-2640-4b32-8d81-65b6a7ec9287" />

##### **Figure 2. State-level prevalence of Listeria presence.**
State-level prevalence of Listeria presence estimated from soil samples aggregated by U.S. state. Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples positive for Listeria within each state. States with no available samples are shown in grey. Differences in prevalence should be interpreted with caution due to variability in sample size across states.

Variation in state-level prevalence suggests that broader regional factors, including climatic conditions, dominant land use, and agricultural intensity, may influence Listeria occurrence. Nonetheless, differences in sampling effort among states introduce uncertainty, and observed prevalence patterns likely reflect a combination of environmental drivers and data availability.

## From Presence–Absence Prediction to Quantitative Risk Metrics: Translating Soil Surveillance Data into Food Safety–Relevant Estimates

Using the dataset provided for the IAFP Modeling Competition, we first developed a predictive model to classify the presence and absence of *Listeria* in agricultural soils. While the resulting model demonstrated strong performance metrics, <mark> we sought to extend its practical value for food safety risk assessment.</mark>

Rather than limiting our analysis to binary predictions, we leveraged the available surveillance data to estimate state-level prevalence and translate these estimates into probabilistic concentration metrics (CFU/g) using a probabilistic framework. This additional step allows model outputs to be interpreted in terms of potential exposure and public health relevance.

Although <mark> these estimates are subject to uncertainty—particularly in regions with limited sampling—explicitly modeling</mark> this uncertainty strengthens risk-based decision-making. By moving beyond classification accuracy and incorporating uncertainty-aware concentration estimates, our approach provides more actionable insights for prioritizing interventions, guiding monitoring efforts, and supporting preventive food safety strategies.

**Table 2.** State-level prevalence and concentration estimates of Listeria contamination in lettuce. For each state, the total number of samples (n), number of positives (k), estimated prevalence with 95% confidence intervals, and modeled mean and 95th percentile concentrations (Cs_Li_mean and Cs_Li_q95) are shown.

### Table description (statistical modeling details)

This table presents state-level estimates of *Listeria* prevalence and concentration derived using a probabilistic modeling framework that explicitly accounts for sampling uncertainty and upper-tail behavior relevant for exposure assessment.

#### Prevalence estimation

Prevalence for each state was estimated from the number of positive samples (*w*) out of the total number of samples analyzed (*n*). Uncertainty in prevalence was quantified using the **Agresti–Coull (AC) confidence interval**. The AC method was selected based on empirical coverage evaluation. Using `binom.coverage()`, we calculated the true confidence level achieved by each method at the nominal 95% level across states. The Agresti–Coull interval demonstrated consistent and reliable performance, with observed coverage ranging from 0.951 to 1.000 (median = 0.983). Importantly, coverage never fell below the nominal 95% level, even in states with small sample sizes.

In contrast to purely asymptotic methods, which can under-cover when n is small or prevalence is near 0 or 1, the Agresti–Coull approach provides stable and slightly conservative intervals. For a food safety application—where underestimation of uncertainty may lead to overconfident risk interpretation—a conservative interval is preferable.

Therefore, the Agresti–Coull method was selected to ensure robust uncertainty quantification while maintaining appropriate statistical coverage across heterogeneous sampling intensities.

**Adjusted prevalence estimate:**

$$
\tilde{p} = \frac{w + z^2 / 2}{n + z^2}
$$

**95% Agresti–Coull confidence interval:**

$$
\text{CI}_{AC} = \tilde{p} \pm z \sqrt{\frac{\tilde{p}(1 - \tilde{p})}{n + z^2}}
$$

where \( z = 1.96 \) for a 95% confidence level.

To conservatively propagate prevalence uncertainty into the risk model, the upper bound of the 95% Agresti–Coull confidence interval was used to parameterize a Beta distribution representing state-level prevalence uncertainty:

$$
p_{\text{state}} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)
$$

where the Beta parameters were selected to be consistent with the observed data and the upper confidence limit.

#### Concentration modeling

Concentration estimates were derived using a Poisson-based modeling approach, assuming that the number of *Listeria* cells per gram follows a Poisson process conditional on contamination:

$$
C_{L_i} \mid p_{\text{state}} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{L_i})
$$

where ( $\lambda$) represents the mean concentration of *Listeria* (CFU/g).

From the resulting concentration distributions, two summary statistics were extracted:

- **Cs<sub>Lᵢ</sub><sup>mean</sup>**: mean modeled concentration (CFU/g)
- **Cs<sub>Lᵢ</sub><sup>q95</sup>**: 95th percentile of the modeled concentration distribution

These metrics together characterize both central tendency and upper-tail behavior relevant to exposure and risk estimation.

Estimating *Listeria* concentration in soil is challenging. Denis et al. (2022) reported concentrations of up to **6 MPN/g** in soils surrounding a lagoon in France. This value can therefore be considered an approximate **upper limit** that would be difficult to observe in non-agricultural soils, such as those sampled in the study used to derive the concentration estimates reported in Table 2.  

Furthermore, Locatelli et al. (2013) demonstrated that the **limit of detection (LOD)** in dry soil can be as high as **10⁴ CFU/g of dry soil**, which helps explain why relatively few studies are able to quantitatively estimate *Listeria* concentrations in soil matrices. These methodological limitations help explain why relatively few studies report quantitative soil contamination data, despite the recognized importance of soil as a potential contamination source.

<mark> In this context, the probabilistic concentration estimates presented in **Table 2** provide a practical and scientifically grounded basis for risk assessment when high-quality quantitative data are unavailable. By integrating prevalence information, sampling uncertainty, and conservative statistical assumptions, this approach enables translation of presence–absence data into exposure-relevant metrics. Such estimates support downstream risk modeling, comparative risk ranking, and prioritization of preventive interventions, even under data-limited conditions.</mark>

## Integrating Weather Data to Enhance Environmental Risk Modeling

To extend the predictive framework beyond the provided dataset, we returned to the original publication and downloaded the full raw dataset. The competition-ready dataset had been pre-cleaned by removing rows with missing values, which resulted in a more balanced class distribution.

While this approach simplifies modeling, real-world environmental surveillance data are typically imbalanced, with many more negative than positive samples. To better reflect realistic food safety conditions, we rebuilt the preprocessing pipeline from scratch.

Instead of deleting observations, we retained all sampling locations and removed only columns with missing values. This decision preserved the natural class imbalance and spatial heterogeneity of the dataset, <mark> creating a more challenging and ecologically valid modeling scenario </mark>. By doing so, we ensured that model performance and spatial predictions more closely represent the conditions encountered in real environmental monitoring.


### Weather Data Integration

To better capture environmental drivers of *Listeria* persistence, we enriched the dataset with historical weather variables obtained from the Open-Meteo Archive API. For each sampling location and date, we pulled hourly meteorological data and summarized them into daily features.

Historical weather data were retrieved from the Open-Meteo Archive API (Open-Meteo, 2024), which provides free access to global hourly reanalysis data. The API was queried using geographic coordinates and sampling dates to extract temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed variables.

The following variables were selected based on strong historical availability and biological relevance:

- **Air temperature (2 m)**
- **Relative humidity (2 m)**
- **Precipitation**
- **Wind speed (10 m)**

These factors are mechanistically linked to *Listeria* survival and transport in soil environments. For example, precipitation and humidity influence moisture conditions, while temperature affects bacterial growth and persistence. Wind may contribute to environmental redistribution.

### Modeling with Enriched Environmental Features

After merging the weather data with the cleaned sampling dataset, we trained an updated predictive model incorporating both spatial and environmental variables.<mark> In this stage, the primary objective was not to replicate or maximize the predictive performance achieved in the earlier, more balanced dataset. Instead, the goal was to evaluate model behavior under more realistic, complex conditions characterized by class imbalance (693 negative samples vs. 311 positive samples), which more closely reflect real-world environmental surveillance data </mark>.

A Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifier was implemented with hyperparameters selected to balance predictive capacity and interpretability. In particular, class weighting and sample rebalancing strategies were applied to emphasize positive detections and mitigate the effects of imbalance.

## Interpreting Environmental Drivers Using SHAP and Effect Size Analysis

To enhance model interpretability and support biologically meaningful inference, we evaluated predictor importance using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and compared these results with independent univariate effect size analysis based on Cliff’s Delta (refer above).

<img width="793" height="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14799ec2-f483-423c-8430-748f7e610a72" />

### SHAP-Based Global Feature Importance

Global SHAP analysis revealed that spatial and environmental variables were the primary drivers of model predictions. Longitude emerged as the most influential feature, reflecting large-scale regional gradients in environmental conditions and land use. Moisture and temperature-related variables (mean, minimum, and maximum temperature; relative humidity) also contributed substantially, highlighting the importance of microclimatic conditions in *Listeria* persistence.

Land cover variables, particularly shrubland, cropland, and pasture percentages, further influenced predictions, suggesting that vegetation structure and agricultural activity modulate soil contamination risk. Elevation also contributed to model outputs, potentially reflecting indirect effects through drainage patterns, temperature gradients, and soil characteristics.

Importantly, proximity to open water and wetland coverage exhibited measurable effects, supporting the hypothesis that hydrological connectivity plays a role in environmental dissemination and persistence of *Listeria*.

### Comparison with Univariate Effect Size Analysis

Independent univariate analysis using Cliff’s Delta identified several variables with strong discriminatory power between presence and absence samples. Shrubland percentage exhibited the largest negative effect size (Δ = −0.44), indicating lower shrubland coverage in positive samples. In contrast, moisture (Δ = +0.42), cropland (Δ = +0.39), longitude (Δ = +0.38), and pasture (Δ = +0.31) showed positive associations with *Listeria* presence.

The concordance between SHAP and Cliff’s Delta results provides robust validation of key predictors. Variables identified as important in SHAP analysis were consistently associated with meaningful distributional differences in univariate comparisons. This agreement suggests that model predictions are driven by genuine environmental signals rather than spurious correlations.

### Integrative Interpretation for Food Safety Risk Assessment

While SHAP values quantify each variable’s contribution within a multivariate predictive framework, Cliff’s Delta measures marginal effects in isolation. The combined use of these approaches enables both mechanistic interpretation and statistical validation.

For example, moisture and land use variables exhibit strong effects in both analyses, reinforcing their relevance as drivers of environmental suitability for *Listeria*. Spatial variables, particularly longitude, capture regional heterogeneity that may reflect differences in climate, agricultural practices, and hydrological networks.

This integrative interpretability framework strengthens confidence in model outputs and supports translation of predictive results into actionable food safety insights. By identifying environmental conditions consistently associated with elevated risk, this approach informs targeted surveillance, land management strategies, and preventive interventions.

Rather than relying solely on performance metrics, this dual interpretability strategy enables evaluation of ecological plausibility and public health relevance, which are critical for environmental pathogen risk assessment.

### Spatial Risk Visualization

To further contextualize predictions geographically, we plotted model-estimated probabilities of *Listeria* presence across the United States. High-probability locations (≥ 0.60) were highlighted to identify potential environmental “hotspots.”

In addition, hydrological features (major rivers and water bodies) were overlaid on the map. This integration provides ecological context, as proximity to surface water may represent increased contamination or transport risk.

By combining predictive modeling, environmental enrichment, and hydrological context, this analysis moves beyond classification and toward actionable environmental risk identification.


### Predicted Listeria Risk Hotspots Near Rivers and Lakes

This map shows the model-predicted probability of Listeria presence at sampled sites, overlaid with nearby rivers and lakes. Higher-risk locations (e.g., ≥0.60) stand out as potential hotspots, helping farmers prioritize where to sample, focus water-related controls, and plan harvest timing to reduce contamination risk.

## Main Spatial Trends in Predicted *Listeria* Risk

The spatial distribution of predicted *Listeria* presence reveals several consistent geographic and environmental patterns when evaluated in conjunction with hydrological features.

First, high-probability locations (≥ 0.60) form spatial clusters, particularly in the Midwest, Upper Midwest, and parts of the Southeast. These regions are characterized by intensive agricultural activity, dense surface water networks, and favorable climatic conditions for bacterial persistence.

Second, many predicted hotspots are located near major rivers, floodplains, and lake systems, including the Mississippi River Basin, the Ohio River Valley, and the Great Lakes region. Surface waters are known to act as reservoirs and transport pathways for *Listeria*, facilitating dissemination across agricultural landscapes, particularly following rainfall and flooding events (Chapin et al., 2014; Weller et al., 2016; Gorski et al., 2022).

Third, comparatively lower predicted probabilities are observed across much of the arid and semi-arid western United States. Reduced soil moisture, limited surface water connectivity, and higher temperature variability in these regions likely constrain long-term bacterial survival. Previous studies have shown that low moisture availability and high solar exposure reduce *Listeria* persistence in environmental matrices (NicAogáin et al., 2018; Osek et al., 2022).

Fourth, localized hotspots are evident in southern and coastal regions, where elevated humidity, frequent precipitation, and intensive land use may contribute to increased environmental suitability. Moisture and temperature have been repeatedly identified as key drivers of *Listeria* survival and growth in soil environments (Locatelli et al., 2013A).

Finally, the spatial gradients observed across longitude and latitude are consistent with the importance of large-scale environmental drivers identified in the SHAP analysis. This agreement between spatial visualization and statistical interpretation reinforces the ecological plausibility of the model predictions and aligns with prior work linking regional climate and land use patterns to contamination risk.

Taken together, these trends **suggest** that *Listeria* risk in soil is strongly structured by hydrology, climate, and land management practices. Integrating spatial predictions with environmental context enables identification of priority surveillance areas and supports targeted, risk-based management strategies for fresh produce safety.

## Why This Map Matters for Food Safety

This spatial risk map transforms predictive model outputs into actionable food safety insight. Rather than treating *Listeria* presence as random, it identifies geographic patterns linked to environmental conditions, hydrology, and land use.

By highlighting areas consistently associated with elevated risk, the map supports targeted surveillance, smarter resource allocation, and proactive mitigation strategies. This approach aligns with preventive food safety principles by enabling risk-based decision-making before contamination reaches the food supply.

In short, the map shifts environmental monitoring from reactive detection to strategic prevention.
